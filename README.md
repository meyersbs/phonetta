# phonetta
(phonet)ic (t)ranscription (a)ssistant

### Description
Phonetta is a web application to help users type International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) symbols - without the need to search the internet for <b><em>voiceless palato-alveolar sibilants</em></b> and other obnoxious-to-type phonemes - through onscreen buttons and intuitive keyboard shortcuts for each symbol.

### Motivation
Essentially, phonetta is my attempt to combine the best features of these sites:
* http://westonruter.github.io/ipa-chart/keyboard/
* http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/index.htm
* http://ipa.typeit.org/full/
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPA_pulmonic_consonant_chart_with_audio
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPA_vowel_chart_with_audio

It is also a learning experience for me as I delve into the black magicks known as JavaScript.
